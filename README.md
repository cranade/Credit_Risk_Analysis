# Challenge 17: Credit Risk Analysis

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

This report is on four Deliverables related to the Credit Risk Analysis. These Deliverables are presented below

### Deliverable 1

The GitHub file submitted along with this report contains well executed codes for algorithms related to Resampling Models.

 Accuracy score for the model is 66.69%.

 The Confusion Matrix is as follows:

### Deliverable 2

The GitHub file submitted along with this report contains well executed codes for SMOTEEN algorithm.

A combination of over and under sampling by using SMOTEEN resulted in only 60.66% accuracy. The following was the related confusion matrix. In this case, the confusion matrix is less satisfactory than the one given in Deliverable 1.

### Deliverable 3:

The GitHub file submitted along with this report contains well executed codes for algorithms related to
(i) BalancedRandomForestClassifier and (ii) EasyEnsembleClassifier.

The accuracy score for Balanced Random Forest Classifier is 79.58% and the confusion matrix is as follows:

### Deliverable 4:

The above report shows that we have successfully executed codes for all algorithms. Our key finding is that the Easy Ensemble ADaBoost Classifier gives the best results with 92.64% accuracy and a better confusion matrix compared to the other algorithms. The Precision Ratio is also the highest for ADaBoost Classifier (94%). As a consultancy firm in Finance we value the precision score the most.

We recommend ADaBoost Classifier for the Supervised Learning Models in the future.
